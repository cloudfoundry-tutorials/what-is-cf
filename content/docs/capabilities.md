As highlighted in the last section, Cloud Foundry allows your organization to focus on the applications, not the platform. It removes the cost and complexity associated with configuring, managing, and securing infrastructure for your applications.

Cloud Foundry is not a generalized compute platform like Kubernetes or Amazon's EC2. It is a platform made for running custom applications new or old. However, Cloud Foundry is not made to run many commercial off the shelf products, such as Microsoft Exchange, nor is it made to run stateful workloads like persistent databases. Kubernetes and other general compute platform are better suited for these workloads.

But for the large group of custom applications being developed in your organization, Cloud Foundry yields significant capabilities. 

* **Any infrastructure**. By decoupling applications from infrastructure, you can make individual decisions about where to host workloads – on-premise, in public clouds, in managed infrastructures, on virtual machines or in Kubernetes. And you can move those workloads as necessary in minutes, with no changes to the app.

* **Interoperability**. Cloud Foundry is highly adaptable and will continue to evolve with shifts in technology so you can adopt new tools, languages, or platforms down the road.  
 
* **Open Source**. Cloud Foundry is an open-source project with an open contribution and open governance model that gives users maximum flexibility to avoid vendor lock-in. We help to oversee a trustworthy community of diverse minds who have come together to tackle all kinds of challenges. More perspectives and divergent thinking mean stronger solutions.

* **Integration**. Cloud Foundry won't disrupt your current workflow. It is compatible with the tech and tools you use today – whether that's AWS or Docker or Kubernetes or Java or .NET – and just about anything in your current environment.

* **Access to services** Developers using Cloud Foundry can provision a wide array of services on demand through the industry-standard [Open Service Broker API](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/). 

Combined, the capabilities of Cloud Foundry yield the best possible experience for your IT organization.
