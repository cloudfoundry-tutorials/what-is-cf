You don't have to be a contributor or member to be part of the community (though you certainly can be!).  The Cloud Foundry community is a vibrant, worldwide group driven by collaboration, inclusivity, compassion, transparency, and curiosity. We hold a collective vision for an ethical, people-first technology community, and future.

We are focused on exchanging practical experience â€” inclusive of people across race, gender, and orientation, as well as lifestyle, level of experience, and area of expertise. We are pragmatic, respectful, and committed to listening to thoughtful and honest perspectives. Our community focuses on bringing together people passionate about building a stable and sustainable platform while being kind to each other.
