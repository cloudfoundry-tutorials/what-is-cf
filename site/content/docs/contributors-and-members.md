Cloud Foundry is a rapidly evolving and growing ecosystem. It is no surprise that some of the largest companies and best minds in the world are actively driving the technology forward.

## The Cloud Foundry Foundation

The Cloud Foundry Foundation is a directed fund of the Linux Foundation dedicated to making Cloud Foundry the leading application platform for cloud computing worldwide.  The Foundation exists to drive the global awareness and adoption of the Cloud Foundry open source project, to grow a vibrant community of contributors, and to create coherence in strategy and action across all member companies for the sake of the project. 

For more information about the Foundation itself, the Board of Directors, staff, and philosophy, read more here: [https://www.cloudfoundry.org/foundation/](https://www.cloudfoundry.org/foundation/).

## Contributors

Cloud Foundry is built by a wide array of companies collaborating to make Cloud Foundry the best platform for developers. Over 40 companies have significantly contributed to Cloud Foundry projects. Member companies include SAP, VMware, anynines, Bloomberg, Comcast, IBM, and Minio. 

### Becoming a Contributor

The Cloud Foundry community welcomes contributors. Getting started as a contributor in the community is the easiest way to offer your experiences and expertise to help grow and improve the Cloud Foundry technology and documentation. Contributing to Cloud Foundry can be as simple as submitting a pull request for a bug fix, feature update, or documentation update. It can be as simple as fixing a typo.

For sizeable or complex contributions, it is always best to communicate with the relevant project team(s) before beginning your work. Sharing your intentions early and updating the community often go a long way in avoiding any surprises. You can find the teams in the [Cloud Foundry Slack](https://slack.cloudfoundry.org/).
