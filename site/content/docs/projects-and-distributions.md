Cloud Foundry is a large, open-source project. The source code is available on GitHub. There are a few different organizations:

- [https://github.com/cloudfoundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry): Core Cloud Foundry projects and components include all source code and documentation.
- [https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks](https://github.com/paketo-buildpacks): A collection of Cloud Native [Buildpacks](https://buildpacks.io) designed for Cloud Foundry and/or Kubernetes.
- [https://github.com/cloudfoundry-tutorials](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-tutorials): The organization that houses this and other tutorials.

Cloud Foundry is a large project with many different components and projects. From these projects, there are many interoperable distributions available for end-users. While these distributions may differ in approach and alterations, they all support the same common core, ensuring interoperability across all Cloud Foundry distributions.

## Open Source Distributions

There are two major open-source distributions under development:

1. [Cloud Foundry](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-deployment) deployed by [BOSH](https://bosh.io): This is the oldest and most widely used distribution whereby Cloud Foundry components are deployed on Virtual Machines on any infrastructure as a service.  
1. [Korifi](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/korifi) is a re-implementation of the Cloud Foundry API on Kubernetes, using Kubernetes native capabilities. Korifi aims to delight developers and operators with a highly efficient, modern model for cloud-native application delivery and management on Kubernetes. Finally, the simplicity of `cf push` is now available on Kubernetes!

## Where is Cloud Foundry?

The open-source distributions of Cloud Foundry can be run standalone or packaged inside commercial offerings. So your company, or even your government, might be running Cloud Foundry, and you don't know it. 

Cloud Foundry is at the core of VMWare's Tanzu Application Service, SAP Cloud Platform, and Cloud.gov. However, this list is by no means exhaustive. Additional as-a-service offerings are available, and Cloud Foundry installations exist in many enterprises and governments worldwide.
